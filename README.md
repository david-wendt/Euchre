# Euchre implementation
Originally part of a project for CS238 with Joey Rivkin and Theo Kanell, in which we wrote an RL agent to play Euchre. (The repo for the project is private.) 

This repo is an earlier version containing a Euchre implementation without the RL agent, written almost exclusively by David Wendt.
